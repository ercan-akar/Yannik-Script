# Plant Monitor Front End
This is a [reactjs](https://reactjs.org) app.
Plots are created with [recharts](https://recharts.org).
[AntDesign](https://ant.design) is used for the UI components.

In the project directory, you can run:

## Setup
Install `nodejs` and `npm`.
Then run `npm install` in `webapp` directory. This will install all dependencies locally.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The app requires the backend server to be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
